quizsocial.sql is the skeleton database I built for the project.
To import the database you can do the following
1.Create a New Database:
  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS quizsocial;
2.Import the Database:
  in your commandline interface use
  mysql -u username -p database_name < path_to_your_sql_file

This data base should give us a good start for our project.
